  *Cultural Studies, Black Radicalism, and the Continuities of Anti-Fascist Theory*

This seminar  invites participants to consider the continuities of critique in the history of Black radical thought and British cultural studies, especially as regards the analysis of historical fascism and new right movements in the writing of figures whose work has been influential across both of these traditions.

Black radical thinkers have often noted the historical links between colonialism and fascism, highlighting the ways in which fascist machinations of terror and genocide were first pioneered as methods of colonial repression, for example the British concentration camps created in South Africa during the Second Boer War which killed tens of thousands of Africans and recalcitrant Dutch Boer settlers. Cases like these lend credence to Aimee Cesaire’s oft-cited assertion that fascism is an expression of the violence of imperialist powers turned inward. Moreover, Black radical intellectuals, such as those associated with the Pan-African movement in Britain during the thirties and forties, or the Black Panther Party in the US during the late sixties and seventies have often been at the forefront of anti-fascist struggle.

In recent years,  these connections between Black radicalism and anti-fascism have been highlighted by critical theorists like Alberto Toscano (<a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/alberto-toscano-tk/" target="_blank">“The Long Shadow of Racial Fascism”</a>). However, connections between critiques of neo-fascist cultural insurgencies today, and the work of the Birmingham school have been less widely explored.  For example, in the writing of figures like Paul Gilroy, Hazel Carby, Errol Lawrence, and of course Stuart Hall, whose contributions to familiar cultural studies texts such as The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in Britain, and Policing the Crisis present conjunctural analyses of emergent new right movements and the rise of Thatcherism during the seventies and eighties that  remain relevant today.

  <h2>Format & Materials</h2>
</div>

In this seminar, participants will consider how each of these traditions speaks not only to each other, but how they continue to speak to us now, offering insights of critique that might guide our attempts to theorize the persistence of racial fascism as a feature of the current conjuncture, and especially as it relates to the unfolding crises of capital we are experiencing in the present, (e.g., in social reproduction, climate change, and public health).

Seminar readings will be drawn from across historical periods and intellectual traditions. The texts below have been grouped according to three overlapping but distinct organizing principles: 
- **(1) a collection of timely and situated responses to racial fascist threats across the 20th and 21st centuries.**
- **(2) key documents from the Black radical tradition, and especially related to anti-colonial thought, which take up the question of fascism.**
- **(3) documents from the Birmingham school addressing the rise of new right movements under Thatcher and anti-racist struggles in Britain.**

***NOTE*** Access to some materials may require institutional log-in. If you have trouble gaining access to any of the readings please contact the session chair, [Steve Gotzler](mailto:sgotzler@andrew.cmu.edu).
